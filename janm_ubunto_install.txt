Process for running "Radio" on Ubuntu 10.10

1) Install processing
2) Install nescessary optional Processing libraries
 * Arduino - http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Interfacing/Processing
   Copy to Processing's Sketchbook/libraries folder
   On LINUX rename libraries/arduino/Arduino.jar to arduino.jar 

3) Install LATEST Arduino package!
   (shouldn't have to do this, but need to copy some libs)
* You will need to enable the "backports repository" in order to get the most recent version.
  Look for "maveric-backports" on Synaptic's Repository/Software Sources/Updates check box.

 copy /usr/share/jave/RXTXcomm.jar -> processing-1.2.1/libraries/serial/libraryw
 copy /usr/lib/jni/librxtxSerial.so -> processing-1.2.1/libraries/serial/libraryw

4) it should work!


Don't forget: if you change the applicaiton then you need to RE-EXPORT
the radio.application
